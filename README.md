# Never Leaving Visual Studio Code

> **_NOTE:_**  It is **strongly recommended** that you use the [Insiders Edition of Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/), which is updated daily, and includes the latest and most up-to-date features for the Python extension, Live Share, Codespaces, native notebooks, and more.

_Never Leaving VSCode_ is a curated set of VS Code extensions for **who don't want to leave VSCode** data analysis, visualization, and collaboration**, inspired by and including the brilliant [_Thinking in Code_](https://github.com/lostintangent/thinking-in-code) and [_Thinking in Data_](https://github.com/dynamicwebpaige/thinking-in-data) extension packs. It also introduces built-in features as well.
